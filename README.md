Convolutional neural network regression for endotracheal tube position detection

This Jupyter notebooks provides a walkthrough for working with MIMIC-CXR data and FastAI/PyTorch in order to create convolutional neural network models with regression outputs that can be used for predicting the position of an endotracheal tube on a chest radiograph.
